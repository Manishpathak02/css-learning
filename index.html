    <h1>Github</h1>

    >GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaboration, primarily for software development projects. It allows developers to store and manage their code in repositories (or "repos"), track changes, and collaborate with others on code. GitHub integrates with Git, a version control system that helps developers track and manage changes to files over time.</p>

    <h2>
        <b>Here are some key features of GitHub:</b>
    </h2>


    <pre>Version Control: GitHub helps developers manage different versions of their code, so they can work on new features or bug fixes without disrupting the main project. Git tracks every change, making it easy to see the history of a project.

Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously. They can contribute code, propose changes (via pull requests), review each other's work, and merge changes when appropriate.

Open Source Community: Many open-source projects are hosted on GitHub. Developers from around the world can contribute to these projects by forking the repository (creating their own copy), making changes, and submitting them for review.

Issue Tracking: GitHub has built-in tools for tracking bugs, tasks, and feature requests, making it easier for developers to manage the progress of a project.

Documentation: GitHub supports Markdown for easy creation of project documentation, including README files, which provide details on how to use or contribute to the project.

Actions and CI/CD: GitHub also includes GitHub Actions, a feature that allows you to automate workflows, such as running tests or deploying code, making it easier to integrate continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) into your development process.</pre>
